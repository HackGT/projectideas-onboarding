# Project Ideas Server

Before starting, check out a live-demo of what you'll be building at https://ideas.dev.hack.gt

## Introduction

To see what each file does and whether you have to edit it, see the comments at the top of each TypeScript file. The main files you will need to edit are the `idea.ts` file, `app.ts` file, and the and the `schema.ts` file!

For the idea route file, you will need to create 4 routes. One to add ideas, one to edit ideas, one to delete ideas, and one to get all the ideas for a user.
